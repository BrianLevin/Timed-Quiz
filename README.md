# Timed Quiz


**Assignment Objectives**

For this Assignment, we had to create a multiple choice  timed quiz that would total up the score of  the users  answers and store the scores  in the browser. The user had to complete the quiz within 60 seconds and would get penalized  and get their time subtracted if they got the answer wrong. The user can then save their  total score in  the local storage after completing the quiz or erase their  score in the local storage. The user can play as many times as they want.

**Syntax Used**

I used HTML, CSS,  Bootstrap, and Javascript for this assignment. I created ID and Class tags on the Html page which linked the Javascript to utilize methods affecting those elements.  I used bootstrap elements to create buttons and forms for the users input. I also used Jquery and regular Javascript to   dynamically target the Html and Bootstrap to make the webpage interactive to the user.

**Learning Objectives**

I want to learn  a deeper understanding of Javascript and how to utilize the language. I want to be able to understand the functions and methods i'm  creating to  show the sites interaction to the user. I also want to continue to practice, design, and utilize Html, Css, and Bootstrap.
